This git repository contains scripts and lists of USB devices that help users
improve USB power management on their Linux systems.  It contains:

 - vid-pid-to-udev-rule.sh: A bash script to generate udev rules to
   automatically turn on USB power management (auto-suspend) when a USB device
   is plugged into the system.  This uses the USB device's Vendor ID (VID) and
   Product ID (PID).

 - known-good-devs.txt: A list of USB devices by VID/PID that have been tested
   and are known to support auto-suspend.

 - usb-pm-tool.sh: A very old and clunky bash script that attempts to guide
   users through testing their USB devices to see if they support power
   management (auto-suspend).  Don't use this, just use powertop.

# List of USB devices known to properly handle auto-suspend.
#
# Keep these in order of vendor ID, then product ID (VID:PID).
#
# Also add a comment with the manufacturer and name of this USB device.
#
# Syntax:
# VID:PID
# VID:PID [auto-suspend delay in milliseconds]
#
# The first line enables auto-suspend for the USB device with the given
# vendor ID (VID) and product ID (PID).  This will keep the delay
# between device activity and suspend at the default (2 seconds).
#
# The second line also enables auto-suspend for the USB device, but it
# sets the delay between device activity and suspend to the specified
# value.  Users may want to decrease the auto-suspend delay for devices
# like USB mass storage devices, since userspace polls them for media
# changes every second or so.
